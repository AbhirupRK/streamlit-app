## ‚öõÔ∏è Magnetic Moment Visualizer

Welcome! This app helps you visualize **atomic magnetic moments** from your **DFT output files**.

### üöÄ **How to Use:**

1.  **Upload:** Select your DFT output file (e.g., `OUTCAR`, `siesta.out`) using the uploader on the right.
2.  **Visualize:** The left panel will show an interactive 3D crystal structure with magnetic moments.
3.  **Control:** Use the right panel to customize the view.

### ‚ú® **Features:**

* Interactive 3D crystal viewer
* Magnetic moment arrows
* Customizing view

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è **About:**

This app was created by Abhirup Roy Karmakar as part of his research.  
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AbhirupRK/dft-tools)\! It has the following dependencies:

  * [**ASE**](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (Atomic Simulation Environment) for handling atomic structures.
  * [**py3Dmol**](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/) for interactive 3D visualizations.
  * [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/) for the web app framework.
